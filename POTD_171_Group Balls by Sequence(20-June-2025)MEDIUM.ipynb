    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "You are given an array `arr[]` of positive integers, where each element `arr[i]` represents the number written on the `i-th` ball, and a positive integer `k`.\n",
    "Your task is to determine whether it is possible to rearrange all the balls into groups such that:\n",
    "* Each group contains exactly k balls.\n",
    "* The numbers in each group are consecutive integers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count frequencies of each number in the array\n",
    "2. Sort unique numbers to ensure we process them in ascending order\n",
    "3. Greedy group formation: For each number with remaining count:\n",
    "* Try to form a group starting from that number\n",
    "* Check if we have all `k` consecutive numbers available\n",
    "* If yes, decrement the count of each number in the group\n",
    "* If no, return `False`\n",
    "4. If we successfully process all numbers, return True\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity:\n",
    "* Time Complexity: $O(n \\log n)$ due to sorting, where n is the length of the array\n",
    "* Space Complexity: $O(n)$ for the frequency map"
