    "## Approach:\n",
    "1. Sort the array:<br>\n",
    "First, sort arr in ascending order. This ensures that when we build subsets, any subset we construct by appending a larger element to a smaller one remains sorted ascending. It also means that divisibility checks proceed from smaller to larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Programming (DP) with path tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let `n = len(arr)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We maintain:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `dp[i]`: the length of the largest divisible subset ending at index i (i.e., with last element `arr[i]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `subsets[i]`: the actual subset (as a list) achieving that maximum length ending at i, sorted ascending.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For all i, `dp[i] = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For all i, `subsets[i] = [arr[i]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iterate i from 0 to n-1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For each `j in 0 .. i-1, if arr[i] % arr[j] == 0`, then we can extend the subset ending at `j` by arr[i]. Form a candidate: `candidate = subsets[j] + [arr[i]]`\n",
    "    * Compare this candidate to the current best for i (i.e. subsets[i]):\n",
    "\n",
    "        * If `len(candidate) > len(subsets[i])`, take it.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * If `len(candidate) == len(subsets[i])`, we must choose the lexicographically greater list (when both are sorted ascending). In Python, list comparison works lexicographically element-wise, so `candidate > subsets[i]` directly gives us the lex greater one.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If we take it, set:\n",
    "`dp[i] = len(candidate)\n",
    "subsets[i] = candidate`\n",
    "* After filling these, we scan through all subsets[i] to pick the overall best:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Track a variable best_subset = [].\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For each subset in subsets, if `len(subset) > len(best_subset) or (len(subset) == len(best_subset) and subset > best_subset lexicographically)`, update `best_subset = subset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Return `best_subset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lexicographically greatest among ties\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because all subsets we store in subsets[i] are kept sorted ascending, comparing two subsets of equal length via the usual Python > on lists yields the lexicographically greater one: i.e., it compares element by element from index 0 upward; the first position where they differ, the larger element yields the greater list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using this in both the inner DP update and the final scan ensures that among all maximum-length divisible subsets, we pick the lexicographically greatest (after sorting ascending).\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time: $O(n^2 · k)$ where `k` is average subset length (in worst case $O(n)$, but typically smaller). For most interview / moderate constraints (e.g., n up to a few thousands), this is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Space: $O(n · k)$ to store all `subsets[i]`."
