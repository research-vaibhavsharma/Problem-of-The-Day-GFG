    "## Problem ststement:\n",
    "Koko is given an array `arr[]`, where each element represents a pile of bananas. She has exactly `k` hours to eat all the bananas.Each hour, Koko can choose one pile and eat up to s bananas from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the pile has atleast `s` bananas, she eats exactly `s` bananas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the pile has fewer than `s` bananas, she eats the entire pile in that hour.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.Your task is to find the `minimum` value of s (bananas per hour) such that Koko can finish all the piles within `k` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach: Binary Search\n",
    "1. Set `low = 1`, `high = max(arr)`.\n",
    "2. Perform binary search:\n",
    "* For mid-point `mid = (low + high) // 2`, check if Koko can eat all bananas in `k` hours with eating speed mid.\n",
    "* If yes, try to find a smaller `s` `(high = mid - 1)`.\n",
    "* If not, increase `s` `(low = mid + 1)`.\n",
    "3. The lowest `s` that satisfies the condition is the answer.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if Koko can eat all bananas at speed `s`:\n",
    "* For each pile, the time taken = `ceil(pile / s)`, or `math.ceil(pile / s)`.\n",
    "* Sum all such times and check if total `time ≤ k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity:\n",
    "* Time Complexity:\t$O(N × \\log M)$\n",
    "* Space Complexity:\t$O(1)$."
